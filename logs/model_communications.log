Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to the user. Optionally you may provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your work. The user may respond with feedback if they are not satisfied with the result, which you can use to make improvements and try again.\n" +

For example, use `open index.html` to display a created html website, or `open localhost:3000` to display a locally running development server. But DO NOT use commands like `echo` or `cat` that merely print text. This command should be valid for the current operating system.
